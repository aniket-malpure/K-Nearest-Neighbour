[KNNRegressor.ipynb](KNNRegressor.ipynb)

This notebook covers:
- Implementation of KNN for regression tasks
- Data preprocessing and exploration
- Model training and evaluation
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Visualization of regression results

### 2. KNN Classifier

[KNNClassifier.ipynb](KNNClassifier.ipynb)

This notebook demonstrates:
- Implementation of KNN for classification tasks
- Data preprocessing and visualization
- Model training and evaluation
- Impact of different values of K
- Visualization of decision boundaries

## Requirements

To run these notebooks, you'll need:
